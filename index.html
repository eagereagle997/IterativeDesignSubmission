                <h2>Part 2: Sketching and Wireframing</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>Pre-Design Thinking</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Before we began sketching interfaces for our Sonnet application we decided as a group that a browser web application would be the most effective interface. The intended users for this application are sales representatives in a wide range of industries. For these users we want to provide a comfortable and familiar experience to the email applications that they use in their daily life. With this in mind we designed the Sonnet interfaces to provide structure in the form of well structured directories, client tags, familiar email interfaces, etc. to help facilitate their navigation throughout the application, while providing them the added value of AI assistance to help them draft sales emails more quickly. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Sketching</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    With the vision from above in mind, we went ahead and designed the following sketches with a focus on diversifying our layouts to generate more ideas. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Design 1 - Traditional Email Design</h4>

                <h3>Combining Ideas into a Wireframe</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Now with these sketches completed, we discussed as a team which sketch interfaces best demonstrate solutions to Sonnet's goals as a company. We then combined our diverse array of ideas into a single, consolidated set of wireframes to represent our vision for the app.</p>

                <p>
                    Now that we have laid the foundations in the previous steps now we are able to build off the wireframe developed and build a full-on high fidelity prototype using Figma, and subject it to a round of critiques.

                <h3>Mockup Critique in Studio - Feedback</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After designing the hifi prototype, we went and grouped up with other students for a critique session. Here was some of the feedback: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In our original iteration we had a pintrest-board like interface as the first screen after log in. General consensus was that the purpose of this page was not clear. As a result, we removed the page altogether in favor of the traditional directory view.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Another common critique was that there was a lack of consistency across the pages in icons, colors used, buttons, etc. In the final hifi prototype we focused on creating consistency across the pages.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Some icons were unclear in their functionality in our original design. For example, a back arrow being used for the send button. We replaced these ambigious icons with clearer ones.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>People generally liked the information that was presented on the client page within the interface.</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Part 4: User Testing</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    User testing is a crucial part of the iterative design process, it provides an avenue to validate assumptions and gauge experiences of actual users.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Determining Tasks and Testing Instructions</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Our objective in developing a suitable test task was to design a multi-step task that took a user through a complete interaction cycle of Sonnet’s main functionality, while interacting with all the contact points of our high fidelity mockup. To clearly define the task to the user we presented instructions that provided context and highlighted the  step by step subtask objectives. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Context Statement Presented to Testers</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The interface you will be testing is for an application that generates personalized sales emails written from scratch for each prospect, by selecting and including AI-generated content blocks.
                </p>
                <h4>High level Task Description Presented to Testers </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Imagine you worked in sales and often had to send personalized emails to your growing collection of clients. One of your clients just experienced a problem You want to reach out to them via email to pitch how your service can help.                
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Extra Details Statement Presented to Testers </h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Please note that the interface you will be testing is not an actual website but an interactive mockup made on prototyping software. 
                    Remember to think aloud as you interact with this interface
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Comprehensive Subtask Descriptions</h4>
                <br>

                    <p><b>Subtask 1: </b> Log in to the application. This prototype will not let you type any text but imagine you did.</p>

                    <p><b>Subtask 2: </b> 
                        You have not interacted with Jeff Huang in a while, open up this profile to see what is new with him. </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            For this subtask one of our main testing objectives was to observe if user intuitions about how to open up a profile from a directory matched our design’s conceptual model. As such we asked the following questions after this subtask:
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Did you complete the task successfully? [Success: Yes, No]</li>
                            <li>Overall, this task was: [Rating scale: Very difficult to Very easy]</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Subtask 3: </b> From Jeff's profile, you can see recent news concerning Jeff and notice his team is experiencing a ransomware attack. Send Jeff an email.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Subtask 4: </b> 
                        Your company sells cyber security tools to deal with ransomware. How would you use the provided AI content options to send an email to Jeff to pitch your product, while acknowledging his situation? Please note that the AI Content blocks will not auto-populate in this demo but walk us through how you would use them. </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            For this subtask one of our main testing objectives was to observe if the design of the email interface made it obvious to the user how they might use the AI tools to generate text. As such we asked the following questions after this subtask:                        
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Did you complete the task successfully? [Success: Yes, No]</li>
                            <li>Overall, this task was: [Rating scale: Very difficult to Very easy]</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Subtask 5: </b> After sending your email go back to the directory page.</p>

                <h3>Analysis of Results</h3>
                <br>
                <h4>Key Takeaways from Testing Results</h4>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generally our test results were positive, with a significant number of user interaction choices and observations matching our design intuitions and conceptual model. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Testers found the interface easy to figure out and straight forward for accomplishing the intended functionality. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Two users expressed interest in a more sophisticated design while one user appreciated the current simplicity of the design. User demography revealed a correlation between the age of testers and their sentiments regarding sophistication of design. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Generally our testers commended our consistent color coding and the presented functionality, acknowledging its relevance for the Sales Industry. Our contact management feature was particularly appreciated.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4>Subtask Result Discussion</h4>
                <br>
                <p><b>Subtask 1 description: </b>Log in to the application. </p>
                <p><b>Analysis: </b>This was a simple step and as expected all testers were able complete this without an issue.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Subtask 2 description: </b>Open Jeff’s profile to see what is new with him. </p>
                <p><b>Analysis: </b>This test was of particular interest to us. Users where able to instinctively figure out that exactly clicking on the name of an entity in the directory list would open up the profile for that entity. This behaviour matched our intuition as was interesting to see. One user selected the checkbox next to the name before selecting the name. </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Subtask 3 description: </b>Send Jeff an email. </p>
                <p><b>Analysis: </b>All users were able to complete this step very easily, the central placement of the email button and contrasting colour made it obvious to users, and they highlighted this fact while interacting.  </p>
                <br>
